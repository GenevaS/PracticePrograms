This is a series of quicksort programs written in a language from each programming paradigm (Procedural/Imperative, Object-Oriented, Functional, Logic).
Each language was used to create three types of quicksort:
  1. Sorts a list of integers in ascending order
  2. Sorts a list of srbitrary type and use a passed in function to compare values
  3. Sorts a list of arbitrary type and uses a passed in comparision function and a passed in partitioning function
